    "# Configuring ParticleBomb\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ParticleBomb` event generator, as its name suggests, can generate multiple particles coming from the same location, called an _event vertex_ or simply vertex, much like a neutrino interaction. The generator is meant for training ML algorithms for generic data reconstruction tasks, so the generation follows a uniform distribution in the specified phasespace unlike a neam-neutrino simulation which is often colimated toward the direction of the beam. For instance, the vertex generated by the `ParticleBomb` is uniformly distributed within the specified volume. Generated particles follow a flat kinetic energy (or momentum, it's a choice) distribution and produced in isotropic directions. The volume in which the vertex is sampled, the multiplicity of particles, the number of vertex to be sampled, the energy of particles, etc., etc. all need to be specified in the configuration file.\n",

    "## The structure and ideas behind\n",
    "\n",
    "It's useful to introduce a concept of an _event_ or an _interaction_. These are interchangebly used here, and they define an occurrence of particle(s) at a unique location, called vertex. A good example outside `ParticleBomb` is a neutrino interaction. The configuration of the `ParticleBomb` consists of two levels of attributes. The top level specifies parameters that govern interaction-level information. The lower level specifies parameters that govern particle-wise information.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, the top level is `GeneratorMPV`, which is a name of this particular configuration. The lower level part can be found under `Particles:`, and it provides particle-wise specification. As you can see, the lower level configuration takes a format of a list (i.e. it is under `-` below `Particles:`). We can provide more than one particle information in this block.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we cover an overview of how the `ParticleBomb` event generator works and how attributes in each block play a role.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How ParticleBomb works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Decide how many time to sample an event. Randomly set in the range of `NumEvent`. In the above case, `[1,1]` means it always produce 1 event.\n",
    "2. For each event, decide how many particles to sample. Randomly set in the range of `NumParticle`. In the above case, `[1,1]` means it always produce only 1 particle.\n",
    "3. For each event, decide where the vertex (x,y,z,t) should be. Randomly set in the range of `XRange`, `YRange`, `ZRange`, `TRange`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to this point, all attributes concern the interaction-level information including how many particles to be generated in each interaction. The next steps concern a particle-level information and rely on the lower level part of the configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Decide which \"_particle_\" to sample. Here, a \"particle\" is an instance in the list of configurations defined under `Particles:` block. In the above example, we only have one particle (i.e. the list length is 1). If you have multiple entries (i.e. \"particles\"), then whether a certain particle is sampled or not concerns two parameters under each particle block.\n",
    "  - `NumRange` specifies how often this particle must/can be sampled. These are specified by two integers, min (=must be sampled at least) and max (=cannot be sampled more than this). In the above example, `[1,1]` means this particle **must be sampled at least once** and cannot be sampled more than once.\n",
    "  - `Weight` specifies how likely this particle is sampled when there are multiple particles defined in the lower block. Note that, at the interaction level, the total number of particles is already defined. Also, the min specified in `NumRange` is respected for all particles listed in the configuration (if this exceeds the number of particles allowed in an interaction, the generator throws an exception and stops). If there are more particles to be sampled after generating all particles with specified minimum count, then the generator use a weighted-random sampling to choose which particle to be generated. If you set the `Weight` factor larger than others, this particle is more likely to be generated beyond the minimum count.\n",
    "5. After the previous step, a particle information is generated. `PDG` is a list of types a subject particle can take. If multiple PDG codes are given, the generator randomly selects one of them. Next, the kinetic energy is sampled randomly within the range specified in `KERange` in GeV. If preferred to randomly sample in the momentum space, `UseMom` flag can be set to True.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, we specified `NumEvent`, `NumParticle`, and `NumRange` all to `[1,1]`. This means, every time, the generator produce 1 event, 1 particle per event, and at least and at most (=always exactly) 1 particle configuration is sampled. That configuration has `PDG: [13]`, which means it's always a muon and energy is sampled uniformly in the range of `KERange: [1,1]` GeV (haha yes, that means it's always 1GeV).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go over some example configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example A: generating four particles\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's modify `NumParticle` so that it always produces 4 particles, and change the only particle's configuration `NumRange` to allow up to 4 particles to be generated. This should produce two muons."
